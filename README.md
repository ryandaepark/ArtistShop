<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I created this website template for SolarBroccoli as an artist portfolio page. I created it customly to showcase his work in a way that emphasizes his art pieces. They include features like natural UI elements, pinterest-style gallery, and emailer for commision requests. The technical aspects of the browser were done by me with small artwork samples by SolarBroccoli. 

### Built With

* Email.js
* React.js
* Tailwind.css

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage
The home page shows the graphic artists first piece with a typewrite effect. This will be changed in the finalized version. I also went with a right side navigation bar that has dropdown for the gallery button and underlines on hover for UI elements as you can see from the other pages. 
![HomePage](https://github.com/ryandaepark/ArtistShop/assets/57121651/8c719149-2ed6-42d0-a454-c172a1928f90)
</br>

The about page is a template to talk about credits and any information that the artist wants to share.

</br>

The gallery page shows 3 sections where on hover it will highlight the section and lift the text to give create a satisfying effect on hover. The 3 gallery sections have two different layout styles. These posts handle gifs as well in the animation section. All items inside the gallery highlight grey on hover with the title of the piece.

</br>

This is the first layout with a pinterest style page where items are in 3 columns and fit any image type horizontal or vertical to fit along it.

</br>

This is the 2nd layout that works with same size images. It will align all items in a grid style matching the height of the biggest item in each column. I created this to showcase the artist's sticky note 1:1 aspect ratio images. 
![GridPage](https://github.com/ryandaepark/ArtistShop/assets/57121651/e059c226-8f40-4d4b-9713-488227a5c364)
</br>

Each item in the grid are clickable and will fit on the screen according to the size of the monitor. This way each item can be seen centered and in detail.

</br>

The commissions page handles inquiries with cost breakdown of each piece. It is also linked to Emailer.js to handle requests through the site. Once submitted, it will lead to a "Thank you" message.
